# lispo
Standard Bourne-like, POSIX-compliant shell functions library for developers.

#### What lispo is not:

This software is not an application, this is only a library for shell developers.

#### INSTALATION:

Just download or clone it and link .inc files from your shell script like this:

. /path/file.inc
`Keep an eye on the [space] character after dot`

Recommended path for .inc files is /usr/lib/sh/
